        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
               <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
               <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
               <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
               <li>1 cup milk</li>
               <li>1 egg</li>
               <li>½ tablespoon butter, melted and slightly cooled</li>
               <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
               <li>2 teaspoons oil, or as needed</li>
               <li>1 cup frozen blueberries, or as needed, thawed</li> 
            </ul>

         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Sift together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Whisk milk and egg together in a small bowl; whisk into flour mixture until blended. Stir in melted butter and lemon zest.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by 1/4 cupfuls onto the griddle; drop a few blueberries on top, then cover each with a little more batter. Cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
