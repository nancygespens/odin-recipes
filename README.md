# Odin Recipes

## Project Overview

This [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes#assignment) is part of The Odin Project curriculum and focuses on building a basic recipe website using HTML. The website consists of an index page and individual recipe pages. The project is developed in several iterations, gradually adding more features and content.

## Iterations

1. **Initial Structure**: 
   - Created an `index.html` file within the `odin-recipes` directory.
   - Added the standard HTML boilerplate and an `h1` heading titled "Odin Recipes."

2. **Recipe Page**: 
   - Created a `recipes` directory.
   - Added an HTML file for a specific recipe (e.g., `lasagna.html`), including an `h1` heading with the recipe name.
   - Linked the recipe page from the `index.html` file.

3. **Recipe Page Content**: 
   - Added an image of the finished dish, a description, a list of ingredients, and a step-by-step guide to the recipe page.

4. **Adding More Recipes**: 
   - Created two additional recipe pages with the same structure.
   - Linked all recipes on the `index.html` page within an unordered list.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Basic HTML structure and tags.
- Creating and linking multiple HTML pages.
- Using headings, paragraphs, images, lists (unordered and ordered), and links.
- Structuring a small-scale web project with multiple iterations.

## Reflection

By completing this project, I have gained a solid understanding of HTML fundamentals. I practiced creating simple web pages, organizing content, and linking between pages, which are crucial skills for web development.
